A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.
we have to find the shortest path from one point to another point.
in this program we have 2-D Array of 9 rows and 10 cols.
we have to find the shortest path between (8,0) and (0,8).
so we get the shortest path in which cells are not blocked
